This is a placeholder file for an announcement video with sound.
In a real implementation, this would be an MP4 video file.
For testing purposes, you can replace this with an actual video file.

The filename 'announcement_sound.mp4' will be detected by the playlist generator as:
- Type: video
- Duration: -1 (full video duration)
- Muted: false (due to 'sound' in the filename)

To test the playlist functionality:
1. Replace this file with a real MP4 video
2. The server will automatically detect it and include it in the playlist
3. It will play with audio enabled
