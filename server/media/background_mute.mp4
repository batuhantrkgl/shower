This is a placeholder file for a background video that should be muted.
In a real implementation, this would be an MP4 video file.
For testing purposes, you can replace this with an actual video file.

The filename 'background_mute.mp4' will be detected by the playlist generator as:
- Type: video
- Duration: -1 (full video duration)
- Muted: true (due to 'background' and 'mute' in the filename)

To test the playlist functionality:
1. Replace this file with a real MP4 video
2. The server will automatically detect it and include it in the playlist
3. It will play without audio (muted)

This type of video is useful for:
- Background ambiance videos
- Silent promotional content
- Visual content that doesn't require audio
