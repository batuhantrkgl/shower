This is a placeholder file for a schedule image that should display for a longer duration.
In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image file showing the school schedule.
For testing purposes, you can replace this with an actual image file.

The filename 'schedule_long.png' will be detected by the playlist generator as:
- Type: image
- Duration: 10000ms (10 seconds) due to 'schedule' and 'long' in the filename
- Muted: false (not applicable for images)

To test the playlist functionality:
1. Replace this file with a real PNG image of your school schedule
2. The server will automatically detect it and include it in the playlist
3. It will display for 10 seconds before moving to the next item

This type of image is useful for:
- School daily schedules
- Important announcements that need more reading time
- Detailed information displays
- Class timetables
