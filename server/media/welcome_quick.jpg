This is a placeholder file for a quick welcome image.
In a real implementation, this would be a JPEG image file.
For testing purposes, you can replace this with an actual image file.

The filename 'welcome_quick.jpg' will be detected by the playlist generator as:
- Type: image
- Duration: 2000ms (2 seconds) due to 'quick' in the filename
- Muted: false (not applicable for images)
